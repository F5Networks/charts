# Contributing Guide for F5Networks/charts
If you have found this that means you you want to help us out. Thanks in advance for lending a hand! This guide should get you up and running quickly and make it easy for you to contribute.  

## Issues
We use issues for bug reports and to discuss new features. If you are planning on contributing a new feature, you should open an issue first that discusses the feature you're adding. This will avoid wasting your time if someone else is already working on it, or if there's some design change that we need.

Creating issues is good, creating good issues is even better. Filing meaningful bug reports with lots of information in them helps us figure out what to fix when and how it impacts our users. We like bugs because it means people are using our code, and we like fixing them even more.

Please follow these guidelines for filing issues.
* Describe the problem
* Include version of k8s, k8s-bigip-ctlr, BIG-IP, and Helm/Tiller
* Include detailed information about how to recreate the issue
* Include relevant configuration, error messages and logs
* Sanitize the data. For example, be mindful of IPs, ports, application names and URLs

## Pull Requests
 We use [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/F5Networks/charts) to automatically run some hooks on every pull request. These must pass before a pull request is accepted. You can see the details in [.travis.yml](https://github.com/F5Networks/charts/blob/master/.travis.yml). If your pull request fails in travis, your pull request will be blocked by travis with a link to the failing run. Generally, we run these hooks:
* Formatting and linting checks are performed

If you are submitting a pull request, you need to make sure that you have done a few things first.

* Make sure you have tested your code. This can be a combination of manual testing and `helm test` hooks, and test methods and results should be summarized in your commit message.
* Prior to merging changes end to end tests may be run against your patch in standard Kubernetes, OpenShift Origin, and OpenShift Container Platform environments. Be sure your templates and tests are compatible with all supported environments.
* Changes should be made to `src/incubator` templates. All updates to `src/stable` will be generated by an F5 Networks pull request.
* Changes should be for source code files _only_ - `.tgz` files will be generated by an F5 Networks pull request after your PR has been reviewed and merged.
* Be sure to include documentation updates in the `README.md` and `NOTES.txt` as appropriate.
* Use proper formatting for the code
* Clean up your git history because no one wants to see 75 commits for one issue
*  Use the commit message format shown below

## Commit Message Format
The commit message for your final commit should use the following format:
```
Fix #<issue-number>: <One line summarizing what changed>

Problem: Brief description of the problem.

Solution: Detailed description of your solution

Testing (optional if not described in Solution section): Description of tests that were run to exercise the solutions (unit tests, system tests, etc)

```
* The messages should be line-wrapped to 80 characters if possible. Try to keep the one line summary under 80 characters if possible.
* If a commit fixes many issues, list all of them
